Let A be a square matrix. An LU factorization refers to expression of A into product of two factors – a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U: A = L U . {\displaystyle A=LU.} Sometimes factorization is impossible without prior reordering of A to prevent division by zero or uncontrolled growth of rounding errors hence alternative expression becomes: P A Q = L U {\displaystyle PAQ=LU}, where in formal notation permutation matrices factors P and Q indicate permutation of rows (or columns) of A. In theory P (or Q) are obtained by permutations of rows (or columns) of the identity matrix, in practice the corresponding permutations are applied directly to rows (or columns) of A. Matrix A of side n {\displaystyle n} has n 2 {\displaystyle n^{2}} coefficients while two triangle matrices combined contain n ( n + 1 ) {\displaystyle n(n+1)} coefficients, therefore n {\displaystyle n} coefficients of matrices LU are not independent. Usual convention is to set L unitriangular, i.e. with all n {\displaystyle n} main diagonal elements equal one. However, setting instead U matrix unitriangular reduces to the same procedure after transpose of matrix product: B = A T = ( L U ) T = U T L T {\displaystyle B=A^{T}=(LU)^{T}=U^{T}L^{T}}, (c.f. properties of transpose). Now U T {\displaystyle U^{T}} is lower triangle while L T {\displaystyle L^{T}} is upper unitriangular factor of B. This demonstrates also, that operations on rows (e.g. pivoting) are equivalent to those on columns of a transposed matrix, and in general choice of row or column algorithm offers no advantage.

In the lower triangular matrix all elements above the main diagonal are zero, in the upper triangular matrix, all the elements below the diagonal are zero. For example, for a 3 × 3 matrix A, its LU decomposition looks like this:
